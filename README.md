BigBlueButtonMeetingManager

Working on a Social Meeting system with Big Blue Button as the back end and nodejs as the main fraimwork the site, The site is primaraly being designed for use with churches and church groups in order to have online bible studys ext... But I can see plenty of other uses for the system

If you want help setting it up, or want to help develop it let me know, Currently I am developing it in my spare time ( I probably put in 4 - 6 hours a week on it ) So progress will be slow, and a lot of it is playing arround with new node modules

Currently I am using 
passport
passport-facebook
express
less-middleware
mongodb ( Unused currently, But I will be using that for my database )

Check the require() for some I may have missed :)
